# Grocery Tracking API Requirements

## Overview

The Grocery Tracking API is a RESTful API that provides functionality for tracking grocery purchases and managing a budget. The API should allow clients to add new grocery items, get the price history of an item, get a summary of monthly spending, set and update a budget for a user, and calculate a user's remaining budget.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Add Grocery Item**: The API should provide an endpoint to add a new grocery item. The client should be able to specify the name, price, and date of the purchase.

2. **Get Price History**: The API should provide an endpoint to get the price history of a specific item. The price history should be returned as a list of purchases.

3. **Get Monthly Spending Summary**: The API should provide an endpoint to get a summary of monthly spending. The summary should be returned as a list of summaries, with each summary containing the month and total spending for that month.

4. **Set Budget**: The API should provide an endpoint to set a budget for a user. The client should be able to specify the user ID and the budget.

5. **Update Budget**: The API should provide an endpoint to update a budget for a user. The client should be able to specify the user ID and the new budget.

6. **Calculate Remaining Budget**: The API should provide an endpoint to calculate a user's remaining budget. The remaining budget should be calculated as the user's budget minus their total spending.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The API should be able to handle a large number of requests per second.

2. **Security**: The API should use secure communication protocols and protect sensitive data, such as user passwords.

3. **Reliability**: The API should be highly available and provide consistent responses.

4. **Scalability**: The API should be able to scale to support a growing number of users and data.

5. **Maintainability**: The API should be easy to maintain and extend with new features.

## Technology Stack

- The API should be built using ASP.NET Core.
- The API should use MySQL for data storage.
- The API should use the `MySql.Data.MySqlClient` library to interact with the MySQL database.

## Packages

To run the application, the following packages are required:

- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc`
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization`
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`
- `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt`
- `MySql.Data`

These packages can be installed using the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio or the `dotnet add package` command in the .NET CLI.
